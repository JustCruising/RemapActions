 Remap action bindings

Some ugly code that allows keys with modifiers to be used when editing keyboard input action bindings.  It has two major downsides.

Downside 1:  Keys that are used as modifiers (eg Shift, etc) cannot therefore be their own action bindings, for example Shift on its own cannot be, say, 'sprint' when held down.

Downside 2:  The ESCAPE key is also excluded.

I am not a professional, more of a hobbiest.  I looked at a lot of youtube and other tutorials and the docs before I finally got a small understanding of how the InputMap works.  At the time I was just fiddling around so ..
.. to all the people who did things that helped me understand ..
.. Thank you and I wish I could remember everyone who put their teachings out there so I could attribute things to you.
